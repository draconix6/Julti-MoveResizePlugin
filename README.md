Plugin for [Julti](https://github.com/duncanruns/julti) which allows for moving & resizing instances. As of **Julti 1.4.0**, this plugin is included with Julti. If you had it installed before, you may now remove the .jar from Julti's plugin folder.

### [Incredible video tutorial by osh](https://youtu.be/oY8W9Esxyb0) (setup Julti first!)

**If you're using ranked/practice instances** that aren't practical to set up in Julti, try Julti Options > Other > Enable Experimental Options, then in Experimental > Utility Mode.

# Troubleshooting

**For the best experience when using OBS**, go to Julti Options > OBS > Align Active Instance to Center.

**If your window doesn't appear in the expected position when resizing**, go to Julti Options > Window > Choose Monitor, and make sure Window Pos & Playing Window Size are set according to your monitor's resolution.

To make custom scripts, [read Julti's documentation on scripting.](https://github.com/DuncanRuns/Julti/blob/main/docs/lua-scripting.md)

### Please note, according to speedrun.com/mc rules, only one out of bounds resolution may be used in any given run.

Example eye measuring with EyeSee window (magnifier + overlay). You may change the overlay in `%UserProfile%/.Julti/eyesee_overlay.png`.
